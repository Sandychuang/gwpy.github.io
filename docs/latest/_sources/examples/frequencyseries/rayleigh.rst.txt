Plotting a Rayleigh-statistic `Spectum`
#######################################

In LIGO the 'Rayleigh' statistic is a calculation of the
`coefficient of variation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation>`_ of the
power spectral density (PSD) of a given set of data.
It is used to measure the 'Gaussianity' of those data, where a value of 1
indicates Gaussian behaviour, less than 1 indicates coherent variations,
and greater than 1 indicates incoherent variation.
It is a useful measure of the quality of the strain data being generated
and recorded at a LIGO site.



To demonstate, we can download some public LIGO data from the sixth science
run (S6) for the H1 interferometer:


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context: reset

   from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   gwdata = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data(
       'H1', 'September 16 2010 07:00', 'September 16 2010 07:10',
       verbose=True)


Next, we can calculate a Rayleigh statistic `FrequencySeries` using the 
:meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.rayleigh_spectrum` method of the
`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries` with a 2-second FFT and 1-second overlap (50%):


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   rayleigh = gwdata.rayleigh_spectrum(2, 1)


For easy comparison, we can calculate the spectral sensitivity ASD of the
strain data and plot both on the same figure:


.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   asd = gwdata.asd(2, 1)
   plot = asd.plot()
   plot.add_frequencyseries(rayleigh, newax=True, sharex=plot.axes[0])
   plot.axes[0].set_xlabel('')
   plot.axes[0].set_xlim(40, 2000)
   plot.axes[0].set_ylim(1e-23, 5e-21)
   plot.axes[0].set_ylabel(r'[strain/\rtHz]')
   plot.axes[1].set_ylabel('Rayleigh statistic')
   plot.show()


So, we see sharp dips at certain frequencies associated with 'lines' in
spectrum where noise at a fixed frequency is very coherent (e.g. harmonics
of the 60Hz mains power supply), and bumps in specific frequency bands
where the interferometer noise is non-stationary.
