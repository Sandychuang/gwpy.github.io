Plotting public LIGO data
#########################

I would like to study the gravitational wave strain time-series around the time of an interesting simulated signal during the last science run (S6).

These data are public, so we can load them directly from the web.
First: import everything we need (and nothing we don't need)

    >>> from urllib2 import urlopen
    >>> from numpy import asarray
    >>> from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries

Next, download the data as a string of text

    >>> data = urlopen('http://www.ligo.org/science/GW100916/L-strain_hp30-968654552-10.txt').read()

We can now parse the text as a list of floats, and generate a `TimeSeries`
by supplying the necessary metadata

    >>> ts = TimeSeries(asarray(data.splitlines(), dtype=float),
    >>>                 epoch=968654552, sample_rate=16384, unit='strain')

Finally, we can make a plot:

    >>> plot = ts.plot()
    >>> plot.set_title('LIGO Livingston Observatory data for GW100916')
    >>> plot.set_ylabel('Gravitational-wave strain amplitude')
    >>> plot.show()
