GWpy Example: plotting event triggers
#####################################

.. currentmodule:: gwpy.table.lsctables

Problem
-------

I would like to signal-to-noise ratio distribution in the event triggers
generated by the `ExcessPower gravitational-wave burst detection algorithm
<https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T1200125>`_ (LIGO.ORG credentials required) , over
a small stretch of data.

The below events were generated by an analysis of data surrounding a potential
gravitational-wave candidate GW100916.
Please see `this data release announcement
<http://www.ligo.org/science/GW100916/index.php>`_ for more details on this
simulated signal and its analysis.

Solution
--------

The test data we will use are packaged with the GWpy source code, so we can
read that file directly from our position within the ``examples/`` directory.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/gw_ex_plot_event_histogram.py
   :lines: 39,42-43

Now, we can use the :meth:`~SnglBurstTable.hist` method to make a scatter
plot of events in frequency versus time

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/gw_ex_plot_event_histogram.py
   :append: plot.show()
   :lines: 46-50

.. plot:: ../examples/gw_ex_plot_event_histogram.py
