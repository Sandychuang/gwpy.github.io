GWpy is package with a set of worked examples, providing step-by-step tutorials on how to use the GWpy package to study data from gravitational-wave detectors.

The examples are provided in the ``examples/`` directory of the git repository, as ``.py`` files, runnable from your console, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd examples
   python gw_ex_plot_timeseries.py

See `the installation instructions <../install.html>`_ for details on how to clone the repository.
